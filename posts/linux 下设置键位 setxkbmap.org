How do I remap the caps lock key?

* For Linux (including Ubuntu):

=setxkbmap -option <OPTION>=


Where =<OPTION>= can be for example of:

- caps:none
  - Disables Caps Lock.
- caps:super
  - Caps Lock becomes an additional Super (aka Win key).
- caps:ctrl_modifier
  - Caps Lock becomes an additional Ctrl.
- caps:numlock
   Caps Lock becomes an additional Num Lock.
- caps:escape
  - Caps Lock becomes an additional Escape.
- caps:backspace
  - Caps Lock becomes an additional Backspace.
- caps:swapescape
  - Caps Lock becomes Escape, and Escape becomes Caps Lock

Note: Xmodmap is deprecated in favor of setxkbmap.
